# I've developed my latest E-commerce API using ASP.NET! ðŸš€
I have implemented robust CRUD operations for products and orders powered by Entity Framework Core and SQLServer.
I have ensured secure authentication to endpoints and role-based authorization for users and admins using JwtBearer Middleware and BCrypt.Net library to hash passwords.

# Required Packages to run this project:
 -EntityFrameworkCore 
-EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
 -EntityFrameworkCore.tools 
-Authentication.JwtBearer 
-BCrypt.Net-Next 
=> Add migrations for the three contexts then update database.
