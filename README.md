I'm thrilled to share that I've developed my latest E-commerce API using ASP.NET! ðŸš€
ðŸŒŸ I have implemented robust CRUD operations for products and orders powered by Entity Framework Core and SQLServer.
ðŸ”’ I have ensured secure authentication to endpoints and role-based authorization for users and admins using JwtBearer Middleware and BCrypt.Net library to hash passwords.
